# Language-Guessing-Tool
This language guessing tool has been made using Node JS. It enables the user to know the name of the language that he/she has input.

I have made use of three node JS packages to develop this tool. They are colors, franc, and langs.

To install these packages, run the following commands in the terminal: 

> npm i colors
> npm i franc
> npm i langs

To use this tool, enter the language in the terminal while running the file. If the tool can detect the language, the name of the language will be returned. Else, "undefined language" will be returned. 

Franc is used to fetch the language code, langs is used to print the name of the language using its code, and colors is used to print colored text.
